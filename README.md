# Unit-4-Code-Quiz



This is my code quiz. You will be timed 1 minute, as you answer 6 questions. The timer will start and you will be presented with the first question once you click the start button. When you answer a question, you will be presented with the following question. If you answer incorrectly, time will be subtracted from the timer. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.
